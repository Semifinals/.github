<p>The new way to develop online tournament experiences. Semifinals is a publicly accessible web API for use developing online tournament services. We take care of the complicated system design of bleeding edge tournament systems so you can easily work on what really matters through our simple and intuitive HTTP API.</p>

<p>We aspire to be the best platform to build tournaments, ranking systems, and other competition-related services. Keep up with our progress in the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/Semifinals/discussions">discussions tab</a>, and feel free to suggest features you want to see!</p>
